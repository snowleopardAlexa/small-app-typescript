1. Create variable 
2. Hover over variable - editor tells you the type of value today has - an object of type date
3. TS knows all different functions and properties that Date object has
4. If you try reference a property that does not exist - TS will underline it as an error 
5. No autocomplete of TS on class because it is empty
